# College Expense Tracker

## Application Description
College Expense Tracker is an application that helps college students manage their finances and keep track of all their budgets. 
With packed schedules filled with exams, assignments, extracurriculars, socializing, and more, college students often face difficulties overseeing their day-to-day expenses. 
This tracker organizes different expenses in a comprehensive interface that students can easily use. 
The system allows users to add new expenses, delete existing ones, and categorize each entry into groups such as food, tuition, transportation, housing, etc. 
Students can also add notes to individual expenses for additional context. Students can then view all expenses and optionally filter them by category to help users analyze their spending habits. 
The system will store all expense data in a file for future retrieval. 
This application will include multiple Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) and will be implemented using Java.
